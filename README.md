# RP_MAE_Joao_Matos
GGP coding in Python

# GGP-Python code
Python implementation of:
 - The Generalized Geometry Projection Framework (GGP) [1]
 - The Moving Morphable Components (MMC) [2]
 - The Moving Node Approach (MNA) [3]
 - The Geometry Projection (GP) [4]

It includes as well a python version of the Method of Moving Asymptotes (MMA) optimization solver [5]. 
Four test cases are currently implemented in the provided python code: The MBB beam, the short cantiliever beam, the L-shape beam and a Wing Rib.

1. **Generalized_projection.py**: Python script that contains the main code.
2. **Generalized_projection.ipnyb**: Jupiter script containing runs for the different cases provided with their graphical solutions.
3. **MMA Solver Python**: Python translation of the Method of Moving Asymptotes (MMA) optimization solver [5].
4. **Top_Rib_MNA**: Python script using MNA [3] to optimize a Wing Rib.
